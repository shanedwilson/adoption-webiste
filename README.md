# Adoption A Pet

- For this assignment we needed to show a main page of all available pets. 3 category(type) buttons printed at the top of the page, colored differently, should filter the pets by type. A fourth button takes you back to the full list.
- I want to be able to click one of the 3 buttons, then only the cards that are in the category(type) should show.
- There should be some way for the user to unfilter the results.
